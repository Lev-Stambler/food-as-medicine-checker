The therapeutic property of almond oil seems appropriate in improving the measured biochemical parameters. It can be summed that phytochemicals of almond oil possess various kinds and levels of antioxidant components and activities. However, the possible mechanism of almond oil attributed to its antioxidant activity which estimated by GSH, SOD, MDA and CAT levels. Natural antioxidants are the plants- and other living organism-derived compounds with a strong potential to inhibit oxidative stress by controlling the formation of free radicals, scavenging the free radicals, interrupting the free radical-mediated chain reactions, and preventing the lipid peroxidation process. Thus, natural antioxidants have potential to balance the irregulated oxidative stress and to restore the cellular homeostasis. Therefore, natural antioxidants can decrease the deleterious effects of various oxidative stress-induced pathological conditions (Ramana et al., 2018). Antioxidants are compounds or systems that delay autoxidation by inhibiting formation of free radicals or by interrupting propagation of the free radical by one (or more) of several mechanisms: (1) scavenging species that initiate peroxidation, (2) chelating metal ions such that they are unable to generate reactive species or decompose lipid peroxides, (3) quenching •O2− preventing formation of peroxides, (4) breaking the autoxidative chain reaction, and/or (5) reducing localized O2 concentrations (Nawar, 1996). Almond oil contains antioxidant and antiradical activity, may be helpful in preventing or slowing the progress of various oxidative stress-related diseases (Hussein and Raheem, 2016). Additionally, the present study suggests that the almond oil can be considered as a promising therapeutic factor against Pb toxicity. Based on above mentioned data, this is the first experimental study indicate that the almond oil is beneficial therapeutic factor for counteracting the toxicity of Pb. Collectively, the present obtained results confirm that the therapeutic properties of almond oil attributed to the antioxidant activity of its chemical components. Finally, further pharmacological and biochemical investigations are required to explore the efficacy of different doses of almond oil as therapeutic factor against Pb toxicity and may be against other chemical pollutants and pathogenic factors.","correlationScore":9}]
