# food-as-medicine-checker

This project seeks to provide backup or lack thereof for commonly recommended “food as medicine” remedies through published literature and scholarly papers.

## Background
The food as medicine methodology is an idea where eating healthy foods and choosing specific foods can help remedy health issues. Many studies have been and are being conducted to verify this approach. Studies such as [this one](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fae8/cbb215a33657de9a8e50b4a590dd2577825b.pdf), [this microbiome focused one](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02146/full), and many others have come out over the past 20 years. There also currently exist many sites, such as this site, which make recommendations of certain foods for certain conditions.
